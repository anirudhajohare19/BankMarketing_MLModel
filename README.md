# 🏦 Bank Tele Marketing Machine Learning Model

This project focuses on predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit product offered by a Portuguese bank. The dataset is based on a direct marketing campaign and includes client information, call outcomes, and more.

We built multiple machine learning models, applied **SMOTE** for class imbalance, and performed **hyperparameter tuning** on the best model – Random Forest – to achieve over **93% accuracy**.

## 🔧 Tools and Technologies Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

## 🔍 Key Steps Performed

### 1. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical summaries and missing values check
- Visual distribution of categorical variables
- Correlation heatmap of numerical features

### 2. 🧼 Preprocessing
- Label encoding of categorical columns
- Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`

### 3. 🤖 Model Building
Trained and evaluated the following models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

### 4. ✅ Evaluation Metrics
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- ROC-AUC Score & ROC Curve

### 5. 🔧 Hyperparameter Tuning
- Used `GridSearchCV` on Random Forest for optimal parameter selection
